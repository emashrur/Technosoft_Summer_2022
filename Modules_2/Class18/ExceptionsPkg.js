/**
 * Java vs JavaScript
 * 
 * in JS:
 * we can have only one catch block with a try block
 * in Java:
 * we can have multiple catch blocks in one try block
 * 
 * Scenarios to use try and catch blocks:
 * if you are using a function or functions which are throwing exceptions
 * if you are using any third party code, library.
 * 
 * 
 * code in finally block will always execute
