/**
 * Constructor
 * 
 *  1.) It's a special function 
 *      in JS : name of the contructor is always "constructor"
 *      in Java : name of constructor is the same as the class
 *      The use of the constructor function is to create the object of the class
 *      without constructor, the object of the class can't be created.
 *      
 *  2.) When there is NO contructor in a class 
 *      JS creates a default constructor, then executes it in order to create the object
 *      If there is a def. constructor, JS uses that constructor instead.
 * 
 *  3.) In JS : we cannot have two constructors in a class
